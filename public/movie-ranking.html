<h1>Best movies according to Lauta</h1>
<h2>Top tier movies to watch</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie of all time <br />
One ring to rule them all <br />
One ring to find them <br />
One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them. <br />
</p>

<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>One of Hayao Miyazaki's masterpieces. <br />
A story of love, magic, and adventure. <br />
With stunning animation and a beautiful soundtrack. <br />      
</p>

<h3>Enter the Void</h3>

<p>A psychedelic journey through the neon-lit streets of Tokyo. <br />
A film that explores life, death, and the afterlife. <br />
Very trippy and visually stunning. <br />
